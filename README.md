# MCI-to-AD Progression Model

**Repository:** [Tao-AI-group/MCI-to-AD-Progression-Model](https://github.com/Tao-AI-group/MCI-to-AD-Progression-Model)

This repository provides code and pipelines for predicting the progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) using deep learning models. The focus is on implementing and fine-tuning recurrent neural network models (particularly BiGRU-based architectures) on longitudinal claims datasets. By leveraging demographic information, and other clinical features, this project aims to identify patterns that can predict conversion from MCI to AD within specific time horizons.

## Overview
The progression from MCI to AD is a crucial area of research as early prediction can enable timely therapeutic interventions. This repository operationalizes a pipeline that:

1. **Preprocesses patient claims data including**:  Age, Gender, Diagnoses, Procedures and Medications
   Diagnoses are mapped into Phecodes. Procedures are converted to CCS (Clinical Classification Software) Codes. Medications NDC are mapped to generic Names.     
   
2. **Constructs patient-level longitudinal data:**
   Patient claims are aggreagated into 15-day encounter periods leading up to the index date. The data are then split into training, validation, and testing sets, serialized into .pkl files for subsequent modeling.

3. **Evaluates the efficacy of a BiGRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) model against four traditional machine learning algorithm:**  
   BiGRU: Tailored to address the longitudinal nature of data, capturing temporal trends in patient health trajectories.
   Baseline Models: Includes Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), XGBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF), providing a comprehensive comparison across various modeling techniques.

4. **Optimizes model performance using Optuna:**  
   Hyperparameter tuning is automated with Optuna, using 5-fold cross validation ensuring optimal model configurations and improved predictive accuracy.

5. **Generates metrics**  
   Optuna is utilized for hyperparameter tuning, employing a 5-fold cross-validation approach to ensure that each model configuration is optimized for the highest predictive accuracy.

The code is designed to integrate different lookback windows (e.g., 365 days, 730 days, etc.) before the index date to tailor prediction horizons and patient stratification based on disease onset. By adjusting these time windows, users can tailor prediction horizons and patient stratification strategies based on disease onset.


## Features
- **Data Handling:** Code for loading, cleaning, and preparing input data (e.g., medical imaging features, demographic information, cognitive assessments).
- **Deep Learning Models:** Implementations of recurrent neural networks and attention-based models tailored for progression prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Automated search for optimal configurations using Optuna.
- **Metrics & Evaluation:** Various metrics (AUC, sensitivity, specificity, etc.) and plotting routines to evaluate model performance.
- **Easy Customization:** Modular code structure, easily adaptable for other longitudinal prediction tasks.
